# Files a basic Linux system should have:
- ag - the silver searcher
- fzf - file finder
- ranger - terminal file searcher
- tree - list out a directory like a tree
- st - suckless terminal (I should make a patched version of this that has all my needs)
- dmenu - I should make a patched version of this again
- fish - the BEST shell
- i3 - maybe not the best but the easiest to learn and most widely available tiled window manager
- kitty - better terminal if you can get it (has some pretty major req)
- htop - top but better
- neofetch - get a system at a galance
- flameshot - screenshot manager but so much better
- rg - the BEST text searcher
